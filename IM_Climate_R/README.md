The IM_Climate Toolkit is a utility package for finding climate stations and downloading climate parameter data for a station or stations.  Specifically, it provides data access via ACIS web services (http://www.rcc-acis.org/docs_webservices.html) to station information and station data that:

+ Supports basic data request functions using consistent (identical) logic:

+ findStation
+ requestData

+ Formats outputs consistently regardless of implementation technique (R, Python)

+ Limits alteration to data returned from ACIS web services
